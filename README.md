This program detects shapes drawn on the piece of paper and once a shape is clicked, it will drop and collide with other shapes on the paper. 

A little bit of how the process is:

# Show your drawing to the web cam

Make sure all the shapes you want are visible.

# Take the picture by pressing ESC

At this point, the program will find the shapes and convert them to Box2d physical objects. It also crops out each shape from the image and "paste" it to the physical object so it will look like the actual drawing is moving on the paper.

# Click on the shapes to have it fall and collide with your drawings!

 Now the shapes should fall and collide like a real physical object!
